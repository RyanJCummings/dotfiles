# Updated Neovim with Packer and Lua Configuration

## nvim Directory
This configuration was pulled originally from ThePrimeagen.  I have heavily modified it to suit my needs but there are still
references to the original.  He should get some credit anyway. Check out his tools such as ThePrimegen/harpoon on his github profile.
This is currently set up for programming primarily in Go but more languages will likely be added.  lsp-zero makes that incredibly easy.

## Old Dotfiles
I might switch back to i3 or dwm in the future and so I am keeping most of the other dotfiles for reference.  I might remove them eventually
as most of them are old and not terribly useful anymore.  If I go back to a window manager, I'll probably use st for a terminal anyway.  Finally,
the Xresources/XDefaults probably won't work on Wayland.  They'll probably be removed eventually but I'll leave them in the Git History.
